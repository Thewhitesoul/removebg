Usage
Prepare a CSV file with the following columns:

ResearcherDirectoryItem__ResearcherImage-u0xee6-2 src: The column containing the URLs of the images to be processed.
researcher-name: The column containing the names of the researchers.
Update the script with the paths to your CSV file, output directory, and output log file:

csv_file = '/path/to/your/research.csv'  # Path to your CSV file
output_dir = '/path/to/your/output/directory'  # Directory to save processed images
output_log = '/path/to/your/output/log.csv'  # Path to save the log file
Run the script:

python process_images.py
Example
csv_file = '/Users/apple/Documents/python/research2.csv'
output_dir = '/Users/apple/Documents/python/finalimages'
output_log = '/Users/apple/Documents/python/image_processing_log.csv'

process_images(csv_file, output_dir, output_log)
